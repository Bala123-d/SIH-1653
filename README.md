## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

1. A real-life Board Room simulation, ensuring candidates experience an authentic interview setting.

2. Al-generated questions tailored to the candidate's expertise, making interviews more relevant and structured.

3. Automated scoring and feedback, reducing human bias while maintaining transparency.

4. Bias detection mechanisms to ensure fair evaluation for all candidates.

5. Data analytics and insights, helping DRDO refine and improve recruitment strategies over time.

## Technology Stack

1. Frontend (User Interface)

• React.js / Angular / Vue.js - For building a dynamic and interactive user interface.

• HTML, CSS, JavaScript - Standard web development technologies for structuring and styling the UI.

Bootstrap / Material UI - For responsive and visually appealing designs.

2. Backend (Server & API Development)

• Node.js with Express.js - For handling API requests and backend logic efficiently.

Python with Flask / Django - If using Python-based Al models for seamless integration.

• GraphQL / REST API - To enable smooth communication bet in frontend and backend.

## Dependencies

1. Data Collection

• Gathering domain-specific interview questions and expert responses.

Requires 10 days for sourcing, filtering, and structuring data.

2. Al Model Training

• Training Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for question relevance and response evaluation.

Estimated 15 days for initial training and fine-tuning.

3. Cloud Infrastructure Setup

• Deploying the system on cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

• 7 days required for setting up databases, APIs, and scaling solutions.

4. Budget Requirements

• Estimated budget of Rs. 1,00,000 for development, cloud refinement. 'ing, and Al model
